-------------HOW TO UPGRADE--------------------------------------------------------------------

To upgrade to version 4.2 requires you to add and update some files from your crea8social installation

You are required to set your site to maintenance mode to prevent your members seeing errors while you
do update

HOW - GO TO admincp -> configurations -> general - maintenance mode SET IT TO yes

ALSO - Enable Debug in case there is error in your update, you and me can figure it out if you enable this value

HOW - GO TO admincp -> configurations -> general - enable debug SET IT TO yes
